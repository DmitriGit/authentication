== LoginModule Bridge Profile


This chapter defines an internal contract that specifies how a server-side message layer authentication module
(that is, an implementation of the ServerAuthModule interface as defined
by this specification) may delegate some of its security processing
responsibilities to a (JAAS) LoginModule. A LoginModule is an object
that implements the javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule interface in the
Java Platform, Standard Edition.

=== [[a685]]Processing Model

The ServerAuthModule must create an instance
of a javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext. If the options argument
passed to the initialize method of the ServerAuthModule contains a
non-null String value for the String key
"javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext", then the ServerAuthModule must
pass this value as the name parameter in its calls to the LoginContext
constructor. If the options argument does not contain a non-null String
value for this key, the ServerAuthModule must use its own fully
qualified class name in its calls to the constructor. In either case,
the administrator of the javax.security.auth.login.Configuration system
of the LoginContext is responsible for establishing the
javax.security.auth.login.AppConfigurationEntry objects (with
corresponding login module name, control flag, and initialization
options) to be returned for the entry name used by the ServerAuthModule
and for the default entry name "other".

If the ServerAuthModule passes a Subject to
the LoginContext constructor, it must pass its client Subject. The
ServerAuthModule must pass a CallbackHandler to the constructor and the
passed CallbackHandler must conform to the requirements of
link:jaspic.html#a692[See Standard Callbacks]."

A new LoginContext instance should be created
for each new request, and a LoginContext instance should not be shared
across different requests. Once a LoginContext object has been created,
the LoginContext.login method may be invoked from within the
ServerAuthModule.validateRequest method to delegate security processing
to the LoginModule objects configured in the LoginContext.

=== Division of Responsibility

A ServerAuthModule must only interact with a
LoginModule in a protocol-independent fashion. Specifically, a
ServerAuthModule is the only entity that may interpret protocol-specific
messages (a SOAP request or an HTTP Servlet request, for example). A
LoginModule must only perform protocol-independent security processing
(for example, verifying a username/password that was transmitted in the
request).

A LoginModule requests information from the
ServerAuthModule using the ServerAuthModule provided CallbackHandler.
Since the LoginModule must only perform protocol-independent operations,
it follows that any callback it requests from the handler must also be
protocol-independent. It is the responsibility of the provided
CallbackHandler implementation to return the requested
protocol-independent information to the LoginModule. The CallbackHandler
is responsible for any protocol-specific message parsing required to
extract the protocol-independent information returned by the
CallbackHandler.

=== [[a692]]Standard Callbacks

This profile requires that the
CallbackHandler provided by the ServerAuthModule to the LoginContext
constructor support the javax.security.auth.callback.NameCallback and
the javax.security.auth.callback.PasswordCallback. If the
ServerAuthModule passes its client Subject to the LoginContext
constructor, the CallbackHandler provided to the LoginContext
constructor must also support the GroupPrincipalCallback. Future
versions of this profile may require that additional callbacks be
supported by the handler.

=== [[a694]]Subjects

If authentication succeeds, a LoginModule may
update its Subject instance with authenticated Principal and credential
objects. If the ServerAuthModule did not pass its client Subject to the
LoginContext constructor, then it must transfer the Principals and
credentials from the LoginContext Subject to the client Subject.

If the ServerAuthModule is implementing a
profile of this specification that requires the module to employ the
CallerPrincipalCallback, then the ServerAuthModule must satisfy this
requirement using the CallbackHandler provided to the ServerAuthModule,
and the CallerPrincipalCallback must be constructed using the
namelink:#a920[23] value that would be obtained by the
LoginModule if it were to use its CallbackHandler to handle a
NameCallback.

=== Logout

When ServerAuthModule.cleanSubject is called
on the client Subject, the cleanSubject method must invoke the
LoginContext.logout method.

=== LoginExceptions

If the LoginContext instance throws a
LoginException, the ServerAuthModule must throw a corresponding
AuthException. The LoginException may be established as the cause of the
AuthException.

=== Issues

The following sections document the more
noteworthy issues that have been discussed by the Expert Group (EG). The
expectation is that standardization of the interfaces defined by this
specification will depend on satisfactory resolution of these issues.

=== Implementing getCallerPrincipal and getUserPrincipal

J2EE containers and other messaging runtimes
are required to support various forms of these methods. When the
authentication identity is provided to the container as a bag of
principals in a Subject, the container needs some way to recognize which
of the principals in the subject should be returned as the caller or
user Principal.



image:authn-4.png[image]

Defined the CallerPrincipalCallback and GroupPrincipalCallback. The
container provided CallbackHandler will handle these callbacks by
distinguishing (in some container specific way) the Principals
identified in the corresponding Callback within a Subject passed in the
Callback.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== Alternative Supported Mechanisms at an Endpoint

How does one use this SPI to configure and
invoke alternative “sufficient” providers, such that satisfying any
alternative within the context results in a successful outcome as seen
by the calling container or runtime?



image:authn-4.png[image]

The getAuthContext method of ClientAuthConfig and ServerAuthConfig was
modified to include the credentials of the client or service subject
respectively so that they may be applied in the context acquisition. The
presence of the credentials during context selection will allow the
acquired context to be matched to the credentials, which will eliminate
one of the reasons, that is, support for alternative credential types,
why a context might need to support alternative (sufficient) modules.
AuthContext objects could achieve transactional semantics by passing
message copies to modules, or they could pass properties requiring
transaction behavior of modules. There seems to be consensus within the
EG that we should facilitate the use of single module contexts by
empowering the config layer to select an appropriate context (containing
a single module).

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== Access by Module to Other Layer Authentication Results

How does an authentication module gain access
to authentication results established at a “lower” authentication layer?
For example, acceptance of an identity assertion for subject S conveyed
within the message at layer Y may be dependent on being able to
authenticate at some lower layer (for example, SSL or perhaps message
layer X), the entity (perhaps other than S) providing or making the
identity assertion.





image:authn-4.png[image]

The ServletRequest object includes attributes that define the security
properties of the transport connection on which a protected request
arrived at the Servlet container. For the Servlet profile of this
specification, we would expect the existing attribute mechanism to be
employed. The general issue remains open, and may be resolved by the
definition of one or more new Callback objects (for example,
getTransportProtection and/or getLayerSubject) to be handled by the
container or runtime.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== How Are Target Credentials Acquired by Client Authentication Modules?

When a client must obtain a short-lived,
service-targeted security token (such as a Kerberos Service Ticket), how
are such tokens acquired, and how might the SPI defined by this
specification be applied to secure any network interactions required for
token acquisition? If the client authentication module is to perform
token acquisition directly, it must be provided with sufficient
information to acquire a suitable token. If token acquisition is done by
the runtime (perhaps) in advance of the authentication module invocation
(for example, during name context interpretation), the authentication
module must be provided with a means to obtain a suitable token from the
runtime.



image:authn-4.png[image]

Extended the AuthConfig SPI to provide for the communication of
properties such as service name at module initialization. Message
exchanges required to acquire security tokens may be encapsulated in any
of the AuthConfig, AuthContext, or AuthModule elements of the processing
model. Also added Subject parameter to getAuthContext call such that the
acquired credential can be passed back to the runtime.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== How Does a Module Issue a Challenge?

How does an authentication module return a
message to inform its network peer that it must do some additional
security processing as required by the network authentication mechanism
being implemented by the module?



image:authn-4.png[image]

Defined AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE and related semantics. Improved the
overview and message authentication chapters to describe multi-message
exchanges.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== Message Correlation for Multi-Message Dialogs

How are the messages that comprise a
multi-message authentication dialog correlated, and where is any state
relating to the authentication kept?





image:authn-4.png[image]

Based on the premise that message-specific knowledge is held within the
authentication modules and that authentication modules are responsible
for control of the dialog, it is assumed that authentication modules are
responsible for tying together or correlating the messages that comprise
the multi-message authentication dialog. Modules are expected to record
and recover any necessary state, and may do so using the facilities of
the containing runtime (for example, persisted sessions). It is also
recognized that there are security mechanisms where message correlation
is dependent on context external to the exchanged messages, such as the
transport connection or session on which the messages were received, and
that in such cases authentication modules will be dependent on
correlation related facilities provided by the runtime. This draft of
the specification does not standardize such facilities. The expert group
discussed two alternatives for providing such facilities: 1) provide one
or more callbacks to allow a module to set and get state associated with
the current transport session; 2) define a module return value to be
used to signal the runtime when it must record and reuse the same
(stateful) messageInfo parameter when it calls the module to process the
next message on the same transport session.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== Compatibility With Load-Balancing Mechanisms

In a load-balanced environment, must the
messages that comprise a multi-message authentication dialog (for
example, the messages of a challenge-response dialog) be processed by
the same authentication module instance, and if so how will that be
accomplished?



image:authn-4.png[image]

Modules may choose to persist any state required to complete the dialog
in a centralized repository. In other cases, such modules may choose to
employ persisted session facilities of the runtime (for example,
HttpSession) that have already been reconciled with load balancing. In
other cases, it may be feasible to extend train the load-balancer to
recognize security-mechanisms specific correlation identifiers in
messages.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== Use of Generics and Typesafe Enums in Interface Definition

Should the SPI be modified to use new Java
language features, specifically generics and typesafe enums, introduced
in Java SE 5?



image:authn-4.png[image]

There is a requirement that the SPI be used in J2SE 1.4 environments,
and an interest has been expressed in using the SPI in J2ME
environments. As such, the specification does not employ these language
features. There has been discussion regarding the use of these features
in the SPI definition, while allowing for implementations matched to
Java environments where these features are not available.

image:authn-4.png[image]

=== [[a746]]HttpServletResponse Buffering and Header Commit Semantics

The Servlet Specification defines buffering
of the HttpServletResponse body such that filling the response
bodylink:#a921[24] (for the first time) can cause the response
status code, HTTP response headers, and first buffer’s worth of response
body to be sent. Similarly, during processing of an HttpServletRequest,
methods may be called on the corresponding HttpServletResponse (for
example, sendRedirect or flushbuffer) that will cause the analogous
content to be sent. In all such cases, the response has effectively been
committed with respect to the status code, headers, and first response
body buffer that will be returned to the client. After a response has
committed, subsequent changes are not permitted to the status code or
headers, and change to the response body is only permitted to the extent
that more content may be appended. As such, when response buffering
triggers a commit, for example during processing within the servlet, a
call to secureResponse, following return from the servlet, will be
unable to effect the response status code, the response headers, or any
response body content that has already been sent (any or all of which
may be necessary to secure the response).



image:authn-4.png[image]

The Servlet Specification defines the HttpServletResponseWrapper class,
which can be used to extend the buffering capacity of the response, and
thereby delay commit until the response is complete. When a
ServerAuthModule requires that responses be buffered until they are
explicitly completed, the module’s validateRequest method should install
a response wrapper when it returns AuthStatus.SUCCESS. Just prior to its
return, the secureResponse method of the ServerAuthModule should write
the completed message to the wrapped response and remove the wrapper.
