== Message Authentication

This chapter defines how message processing
runtimes invoke authentication modules to secure or validate request and
response messages. It describes the interactions that occur between
message processing runtimes and authentication modules to cause security
guarantees to be enforced on request and response messages.

The subsections of this chapter establish the
common requirements that pertain to the use of this specification in a
generic message processing context. Profiles are expected to be defined
to establish the specific requirements pertaining to the use of this
specification in a particular message processing context.

The API defined by this specification is
intended to have more general applicability than the contexts of use
defined in this specification. To that end, a runtime that provides
compatible Java definitions of the interfaces defined by this
specification and compatible Java implementations of the defined classes
satisfies the baseline compatibility requirements of this specification.

=== [[a265]]Authentication

As defined in
link:jaspic.html#a151[See Typical Runtime Use Model],” a
message processing runtime’s interaction with the interfaces defined by
this specification is divided into the following five phases:

Acquire AuthConfigProvider – Runtime acquires
a provider of authentication context configuration objects for the
relevant messaging layer and application identifier.

Acquire AuthConfig – Runtime acquires the
authentication context configuration object for the application from the
provider.

Acquire AuthContext Identifier – Runtime
acquires the authentication context identifier corresponding to the
messages to be processed.

Acquire Authentication Context – Runtime uses
the context identifier to obtain the corresponding authentication
context.

Process Message(s) – Runtime uses the
authentication context to process the messages.

The remaining sections of this chapter define
the requirements that must be satisfied by messaging runtimes and
providers in support of each of the five interactions identified above.

=== [[a273]]Acquire AuthConfigProvider

=== [[a274]]What the Runtime Must Do

For a message processing runtime to be able
to invoke authentication modules configured according to this
specification, the JVM of the message processing runtime must have been
configured or initialized such that it has loaded the abstract
AuthConfigFactory class, and such that the getFactory method of the
abstract class (loads, as necessary, and) returns a concrete
implementation of AuthConfigFactory. When called by the messaging
runtime with layer and appContext arguments, the getConfigProvider
method of the returned factory implementation must return the
corresponding (as a result of configuration or registration)
AuthConfigProvider object (or null if no provider is configured for the
arguments).

This specification defines authorization
protected configuration interfaces, and a message processing runtime
must support the granting, to applications and administration utilities,
of the permissions required to employ these configuration interfaces.

A message processing runtime that wishes to
invoke authentication modules configured according to this specification
must use the AuthConfigFactory.getFactory method to obtain a factory
implementation. The runtime must invoke the getConfigProvider method of
the factory to obtain the AuthConfigProvider. The runtime must specify
appropriate (non-null) layer and application context identifiers in its
call to getConfigProvider. The specified values must be as defined by
the profile of this specification being followed by the messaging
runtime.

A runtime may continue to reuse a provider
for as long as it wishes. However, a runtime that wishes to be notified
of changes to the factory that would cause the factory to return a
different provider for the layer and appContext arguments should include
a (non-null) RegistrationListener as an argument in the call used to
acquire the provider. When a listener argument is included in the call
to acquire a provider, the factory will invoke the notify method of the
listener when the correspondence between the provider and the layer and
application context for which it had been acquired is no longer in
effect. When the notify method is invoked by the factory, the runtime
should reacquire an AuthConfigProvider for the layer and application
context.

=== What the Factory Must Do

The factory implementation must satisfy the
requirements defined by the AuthConfigFactory class. In particular, it
must offer a public, zero argument constructor that supports the
construction and registration of AuthConfigProvider objects from a
persistent declarative representation.

=== Acquire AuthConfig

=== What the Runtime Must Do

Once the runtime has obtained the appropriate
(non-null) AuthConfigProvider, it must obtain from the provider the
authentication context configuration object corresponding to the
messaging layer, its role as client or server, and the application
context for which it will be exchanging messages. It does this by
invoking getClientAuthConfig or getServerAuthConfig as appropriate to
the role of the runtime in the message exchange. A runtime operating at
points 1 and 4 in the messaging model must invoke getClientAuthConfig to
acquire its configuration object. A runtime operating at points 2 and 3
in the messaging model must invoke getServerAuthConfig to acquire its
configuration object. The call to acquire the configuration object must
specify the same values for layer and application context identifier
that were used to acquire the provider. Depending on the profile of this
specification being followed by the messaging runtime, a CallbackHandler
may also be a required argument of the call to acquire the configuration
object. When a profile requires a CallbackHandler, the profile must also
specify the callbacks that must be supported by the handler.

A runtime may continue to reuse an acquired
authentication context configuration object for as long as it is acting
as client or server of the corresponding application. A runtime should
reacquire an authentication context configuration object when it is
notified (through a RegistrationListener) that it must reacquire the
AuthConfigProvider from which the configuration object was acquired (and
after having reacquired the provider).

=== [[a285]]What the Provider Must Do

The provider implementation must satisfy the
requirements defined by the AuthConfigProvider interface. In particular,
it must return non-null authentication configuration objects. Moreover,
when the provider is a dynamic configuration provider, any change to the
internal state of the provider occurring as the result of a call to its
refresh method must be recognized by every authentication context
configuration object obtained from the provider.

The provider implementation must provide a
configuration facility that may be used to configure the information
required to initialize authentication contexts for the (one or more)
authentication context configuration scopes (defined by layer and
application context) for which the provider is registered (at the
factory).

To allow for delegation of session management
to authentication contexts and their contained authentication modules,
it must be possible for one or more of the authentication context
configuration scopes handled by an AuthConfigProvider to be configured
such that the getAuthContext method of the corresponding authentication
context configuration objects will return a non-null authentication
context for all authentication context identifier values, independent of
whether or not the corresponding messages require protection. In this
case, contexts returned for messages for which protection is NOT
required must initialize their contained authentication modules with
request and/or response MessagePolicy objects for which isMandatory()
returns false (while allowing for the case where one of either request
or response policy may be null).

A sample and perhaps typical context
initialization model is described in
Sectionlink:jaspic.html#a302[See What the Configuration Must
Do]. Providers must offer a configuration facility sufficient to sustain
the typical context initialization model.

=== [[a290]]Acquire AuthContext Identifier

=== What the Runtime Must Do

At points (1) and (2) in the messaging model,
the message processing runtime must obtain the authentication context
identifier corresponding to the request message processing being
performed by the runtime.

The identifier may be acquired by calling the
getAuthContextID method of the authentication context configuration
object (obtained in the preceding step). If the messaging runtime
chooses to obtain the context identifier by this means, it must provide
a MessageInfo object as argument to the getAuthContextID call, and the
MessageInfo must have been initialized such that its getRequestMessage
method will return the request message being processed by the runtime.
The type of the returned request message must be as defined by the
profile of this specification being followed by the messaging runtime.

Alternatively and depending on the
requirements relating to authentication context identifier inherent in
the profile being followed by the messaging runtime, the runtime may
obtain the identifier by other means. Where a profile defines or
facilitates other means by which a messaging runtime may acquire the
identifier, the identifier acquired by any such means must be equivalent
to the identifier that would be acquired by calling getAuthContextID as
described above.

=== What the Configuration Must Do

The configuration implementation must satisfy
the requirements defined by the AuthConfig interface with respect to the
getAuthContextID method.

=== [[a297]]Acquire Authentication Context

=== What the Runtime Must Do

At points (1) and (2) in the messaging model,
the message processing runtime must invoke the getAuthContext method of
the authentication context configuration object (obtained in step 2) to
obtain the authentication context object corresponding to the message
that is to be processed. This is accomplished by invoking getAuthContext
with the authentication context identifier corresponding to the request
message and obtained as described above. If required by the profile of
this specification being followed by the runtime, the call to
getAuthContext must pass a Map containing the required property
elements. The value of the Subject argument provided by the runtime in
its call to getAuthContext must correspond to the requirements of the
profile of this specification being followed by the runtime.

 Once an authentication context is acquired,
it may be reused to process subsequent requests of the application for
which an equivalent authentication context identifier, Subject, and
properties Map (as used in the getAuthContext) applies. Runtimes that
wish to be dynamic with respect to changes in context configuration
should call getAuthContext for every request. An authentication context
configuration object may return the same authentication context object
for different authentication context identifiers for which the same
module configuration and message protection policy applies.

At points (3) and (4) in the messaging model,
the runtime may repeat the context acquisition performed at point (2)
and (1) respectively, or it may reuse the previously acquired context.

=== [[a302]]What the Configuration Must Do

The configuration implementation must satisfy
the requirements defined by the corresponding ClientAuthConfig or
ServerAuthConfig interface with respect to the getAuthContext method. In
this regard, the configuration implementation must determine the
authentication modules that are to comprise the acquired context, and it
must provide the context implementation with sufficient information to
initialize the modules of the context. The getAuthContext method must
return null when no authentication modules are to be invoked for an
identified authentication context at the layer and application context
represented by the configuration object.

The interfaces by which an authentication
context configuration object obtains a properly configured or
initialized authentication context object are implementation-specific.
That said, it is expected that the typical context initialization will
require the following information:

* The CallbackHandler (if any) to be passed
to the modules of the context
* A list of one or more module configurations
(one for each module of the context), and where each such configuration
conveys (either directly or indirectly) the following information:

The implementation class for the
authentication module (that is, an implementation of the
ClientAuthModule or ServerAuthModule interface as appropriate to the
type of the containing context)

The module specific initialization properties
(in a form compatible with conveyance to the module by using a Map)

The request and response MessagePolicy
objects for the module

The context-specific control attributes to be
used by the context to coordinate the invocation of the module with
respect to the other modules of the context

To sustain the above requirements, the
AuthConfigProvider from which the authentication context configuration
object was acquired must provide a configuration facility by which the
information required to initialize authentication contexts may be
configured and associated with one or more authentication context
identifiers within the (one or more) layer and application context
scopes for which the provider is registered (at the factory).

=== Process Messages

=== What the Context Must Do

Every context implementation must satisfy the
requirements as defined by the corresponding ClientAuthContext or
ServerAuthContext interface.

Every context is responsible for constructing
and initializing the one or more authentication modules assigned to the
context by the authentication context configuration object. The
initialization step includes passing the relevant request and response
MessagePolicy objects to the authentication modules. These policy
objects may have been acquired by the authentication context
configuration object and provided as arguments through the internal
interfaces used by the configuration object to acquire the context.

Every context must delegate calls made to the
methods of its corresponding ClientAuth or ServerAuth interface to the
corresponding methods of its one or more authentication modules. If a
context encapsulates multiple authentication modules, the context must
embody the control logic to determine which modules of the context are
to be invoked and in what order. Contexts which encapsulate alternative
sufficient modules must ensure that the same message values are passed
to each invoked alternative of the context. If a context invokes
multiple authentication modules, the context must combine the AuthStatus
values returned by the invoked authentication modules to establish the
AuthStatus value returned by the context to the messaging runtime. The
context implementation must define the logic for combining the returned
AuthStatus values.

=== [[a317]]What the Runtime Must Do

If a non-null authentication context object
is returned by getAuthContext, the corresponding message processing
runtime must invoke the methods of the acquired authentication context
to process the corresponding request and response messages as defined
below. Otherwise, the message processing runtime must proceed with its
normal processing of the corresponding messages and without invoking the
methods of an authentication context object.

=== At point (1) in the message processing model:

* The message processing runtime must call
the secureRequest method of the ClientAuthContext.
* The messageInfo argument to the call must
have been initialized such that its getRequestMessage method will return
the request message being processed by the runtime. The type of the
returned request message must be as defined by the profile being
followed.
* If a non-null Subject was used to acquire
the ClientAuthContext, the same Subject must be passed as the
clientSubject in this call. If a non-null clientSubject is used in this
call, it must not be read-only, and the same clientSubject argument must
be passed in all calls to validateResponse made for the one or more
responses processed to complete the message exchange.
* If the call to secureRequest returns:

AuthStatus.SEND_SUCCESS – The runtime should
send (without calling secureRequest) the request message acquired by
calling messageInfo.getRequestMessage. After sending the request, the
runtime should proceed to point (4) in the message processing model (to
receive and validate the response).

AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE – The module has
returned, in messageInfo, an initial request message to be sent.
Moreover, the module is informing the client runtime that it will be
required to continue the message dialog by sending the message resulting
from validation of the response to the initial message. If the runtime
will be unable to continue the dialog by sending the message resulting
from validation of the response, the runtime must not send the initial
request and must convey its inability by returning an error to the
client application. Otherwise, the runtime should send (without calling
secureRequest) the request message acquired by calling
messageInfo.getRequestMessage.

AuthStatus.FAILURE – The runtime should
return an error to the client application. The runtime should derive the
returned error from the response message acquired by calling
messageInfo.getResponseMessage.

Throws an AuthException – The runtime should
use the exception to convey to the client runtime that the request
failed.

=== At point (4) in the message processing model:

* The message processing runtime must call
the validateResponse method of the ClientAuthContext.
* In the call made to validateResponse, the
runtime must pass the same MessageInfo instance that was passed to
secureRequest (at the start of the message exchange). The messageInfo
argument must have been initialized such that its getResponseMessage
method will return the response message being processed by the
runtime.The type of the required return messages must be as defined by
the profile being followed.
* The value of the clientSubject argument to
the call must be the same as that passed in the call to secureRequest
for the corresponding request.
* The serviceSubject argument to the call may
be non-null, in which it must not be read-only and may be used by
modules to store Principals and credentials determined to pertain to the
source of the response.
* If the call to validateResponse returns:

AuthStatus.SUCCESS – The runtime should use
the response message acquired by calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage
to create the value to be returned to the client.

AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE – If the runtime is
unable to process this status value, it must return an error to the
client application indicating its inability to process this status
value. To process this status value, the runtime must send (without
calling secureRequest) the (continuation) request message obtained by
calling messageInfo.getRequestMessage, and it must receive and process
by using validateResponse (at least) the next corresponding response or
error (before returning a value to the client).

AuthStatus.FAILURE – The runtime should
return an error to the client application. The runtime should derive the
returned error from the response message acquired by calling
messageInfo.getResponseMessage.

Throws an AuthException – The runtime should
use the exception to convey to the client runtime that the request
failed.

=== State Diagram of Client Message Processing Runtime

=== At point (2) in the message processing model:

* The message processing runtime must call
the validateRequest method of the ServerAuthContext.
* The messageInfo argument to the call must
have been initialized such that its getRequestMessage method will return
the request message being processed by the runtime. For some profiles of
this specification, the runtime must also initialize messageInfo such
that its getResponseMessage method will return the response message
being processed by the runtime. The type of the required return messages
must be as defined by the profile being followed.
* The clientSubject argument must be non-null
and it must not be read-only. It is expected that the modules of the
authentication context will populate this Subject with principals and
credentials resulting from their processing of the request message.
* If a non-null Subject was used to acquire
the ServerAuthContext, the same Subject must be passed as the
serviceSubject in this call. If a non-null serviceSubject is used in
this call, it must not be read-only, and the same serviceSubject must be
passed in the call to secureResponse for the corresponding response (if
there is one).
* If the call to validateRequest returns:

AuthStatus.SUCCESS – The runtime should
proceed to authorize the request using the clientSubject, perform the
application request processing (depending on the authorization result),
and proceed to point (3) as appropriatelink:#a901[4].

AuthStatus.SEND_SUCCESS – The runtime should
send (without calling secureResponse) the response message acquired by
calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage, at which time the processing of
the application request and its corresponding response will be complete.
The runtime must NOT proceed to authorize the request or perform the
application request processing.

AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE – The runtime should
send (without calling secureResponse) the response message acquired by
calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage. The runtime must NOT proceed to
authorize the request or perform the application request processing. The
processing of the application request is not finished, and as such, its
outcome is not yet known.

AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE – The runtime must
NOT proceed to authorize the request or perform the application request
processing. If the failure occurred afterlink:#a902[5] the
service invocation, the runtime must perform whatever processing it
requires to complete the processing of a request that failed after a
successful service invocation, and prior to communicating the invocation
result to the client runtime. The runtime may send (without calling
secureResponse) the response message acquired by calling
messageInfo.getResponseMessage.

Throws an AuthException – The runtime must
NOT proceed to authorize the request or perform the application request
processing. If the failure occurred after the service invocation, the
runtime must perform whatever processing it requires to complete the
processing of a request that failed after the service invocation, and
prior to communicating the invocation result to the client runtime. The
runtime may send (without calling secureResponse) a failure message of
its choice. If a failure message is returned, it should indicate whether
the failure in request processing occurred before or after the service
invocation.

=== At point (3) in the message processing model:

* The message processing runtime must call
the secureResponse method of the ServerAuthContext. The call to
secureResponse should be made independent of the result of the
application request processing.
* In the call made to secureResponse, the
runtime must pass the same MessageInfo instance that was passed to
validateRequest (for the corresponding request message). The messageInfo
argument must have been initialized such that its getResponseMessage
method will return the response message being processed by the runtime.
The type of the required return messages must be as defined by the
profile being followed.
* The value of the serviceSubject argument to
the call must be the same as that passed in the call to validateRequest
for the corresponding request.
* If the call to secureResponse returns:

AuthStatus.SEND_SUCCESS – The runtime should
send (without calling secureResponse) the response message acquired by
calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage at which time the processing of
the application request and its corresponding response will be complete.

AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE – The runtime should
send (without calling secureResponse) the response message acquired by
calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage. The processing of the response
is not finished, and as such, its outcome is not yet known.

AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE – The runtime must
perform whatever processing it requires to complete the processing of a
request that failed after (or during) service invocation, and prior to
communicating the invocation result to the client runtime. This may
include sending (without calling secureResponse) the response message
acquired by calling messageInfo.getResponseMessage.

Throws an AuthException – The runtime must
perform whatever processing it requires to complete the processing of a
request that failed after (or during) service invocation, and prior to
communicating the invocation result to the client runtime. The runtime
may send (without calling secureResponse) an appropriate response
message of its choice. If a failure message is returned, it should
indicate that the failure in request processing occurred after the
service invocation.

within the context must satisfy the requirements as defined by the
corresponding ClientAuthModule or ServerAuthModule interface.
